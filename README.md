# Robotic Manipulators Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

Robotic manipulators are used for automating processes in industry, saving human labor in
unhealthy work environments and from repetitive tasks. Traditional control approaches require
structured environments, since the manipulator program is defined step by step. However, itâ€™s
difficult to obtain an environment fully adapted to the limitations of these approaches, mainly in
the reality of the industry. The robotic manipulator control using Deep Reinforcement Learning
has several advantages compared to the classical approaches. In this strategy, an intelligent
agent is trained with rewards to learn to control the robot for a given application. The result of
this approach is a control solution with real time trajectory generation for complex applications,
dispensing previous trajectory programming provided by a human expert. This work proposes a
control methodology for the robotic manipulator OpenMANIPULATOR-X to perform a reaching
task on Robot Operating System. The approach is based on Deep Reinforcement Learning
and the work is divided in three steps: understand and operate the OpenMANIPULATOR-X;
implement the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm combined with Hindsight Experience Replay; integrate
and evaluate the intelligent controller with the manipulator in Robot Operating System. The
results demonstrated that the methodology is promising for robotic manipulator control in more
complex applications.
